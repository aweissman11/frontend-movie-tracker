# movieTracker

## Description

Movie tracker is a web application designed to allow the user to create a collection of their favorite films. Users can search films by title, browse them via a combination of genre, rating, year of release, and sort them via a series of parameters. Movie data is populated via [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). Account handling is done via a local backend built in Express.

This project is a part of the Front End Engineering Program at the Turing School of Software and Design. You can find the specs for it [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker).
